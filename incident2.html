                              <p>Dusty and bumpy roads in the city are making the life of residents miserable. After the rain, slush on the roads has dried up and transformed into dust. The dust is Rs 50 lakh a few years ago, but it failed to utilise it properly, said civic activist Isaac Dev. “I have not seen the road sweeping machine working in the last few years. Dust is causing inconvenience to motorists and pedestrians on Karwar Road, Heggeri Road, Cotton Market and Station Road,” he said. Because of dust, people are facing skin and respiratory problems in the city. Plastic surgeon Dr SS Shirol said there is definitely a rise in cases related to skin irritation, eye irritation, hair fall and acne Dr Shirol advised people, especially women, to half-cover their faces with scarf and wear helmets to avoid dust. Civic activist Dr MC Sindhur said, “HDMC officials are not working for public good. The taxpayers are suffering due to the apathy and lethargy of the officials. We are expecting the new commissioner to take action in this regard. If action is further delayed we will launch an agitation against HDMC demanding good roads. Dhruva Kulkarni, an employee in a private firm said that because of unscientific roads people of Hubballi face dust problem round the year. Manisha Toshikhani, a second-year engineering student, said that because of dust she is taking treatment for pimples since the past two years. She said she wears a scarf and helmet to protect herself from dust..</p>
